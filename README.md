# 🚦 **Trafic Light Application**

## 📖 **Introduction**
The **Trafic Light Application** is a mobile project simulating real-world traffic light systems. It provides functionality to switch between day and night modes and includes a power-off button to simulate turning off the traffic light system. This application is a practical demonstration of managing UI states and transitions in Android development.
